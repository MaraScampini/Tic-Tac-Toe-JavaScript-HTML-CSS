# Tic-tac-toe project

Third weekly project for Geekshubs Academy's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

The challenge this week was to create a fully functional and responsive game of tic-tac-toe.

I used this icon (add image) as inspiration for the color palette and design of the game.

We have five total views:
- Home
- Tutorial
- Player select
- Game
- Winner

All of them are connected to each other and one can navigate to every one of the pages (except the winner page, which only appears after playing a full game).

## Functionalities

- Each player can take off and place again their marks after reaching a maximum of three marks.
- CPU can be selected both for player 1 and player 2. If CPU is player 1, CPU starts the game.
- Turn display in the main game screen, changes depending on how many marks the player has left.

## Technologies used

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript ES6
